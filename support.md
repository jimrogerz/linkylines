## FAQ

### How do I play the game?

Connect all like colored pairs of dots to clear a level.

### Why are some levels I completed no longer checked?

We may publish updates to the levels from time to time. New levels that have not been completed will not be checked.

### How can I remove ads?

Most of the full screen ads between levels can be closed early by clicking in the upper left corner of the ad. You'll also find a `Remove ads` button in settings, which is $1.99 US.

### What devices is the game compatible with?

* iPhone and iPad with iOS version 12+
* Android is in pre-release mode. You can try it by joining [https://groups.google.com/g/linkylines](https://groups.google.com/g/linkylines), and installing it from [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jimrogers.linkylines](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jimrogers.linkylines).
